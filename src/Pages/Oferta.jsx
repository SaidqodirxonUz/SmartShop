              The first step in creating your irresistible offer is to be very
              clear about whatever it is that you're selling. Confused people
              will not buy from you. This is where your copywriting skills must
              come into play. Ensure that you develop and deliver a very clear
              and easily understood offer if you want people to purchase. The
              best way you can do this is to accurately depict and convey the
              purpose of whatever it is that you're offering. Be specific about
              this. Don't use clouded words that don't properly relate the
              offer. Use numbers, dates or percentages to portray specifics of
              the offer while ensuring that the title is intriguing, relevant to
              your audience and that it makes a promise that can be delivered
              through whatever it is that you're peddling.
